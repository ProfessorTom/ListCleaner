There has to be a better way to do thisâ€“probably something simple in Excel. Alas, Apple Numbers didn't have the functionality I needed to split the contents of the Title & Author column. (At least, *LEFT* and *RIGHT* couldn't do the job because they needed to know how many characters to return which was variable. Perphaps one could have counted the characters as a sub-function.)

Though there is almost certainly a better way to solve the problem, where's the fun in that, especially when one can write code to do the job? Ergo, I wrote a program to solve my problem.
